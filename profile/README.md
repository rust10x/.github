The Rust Production Coding Blueprints repository is maintained by Jeremy Chone (https://youtube.com/jeremychone).

All public repositories are licensed under the Apache 2.0 OR MIT licenses. Feel free to use them as you like.

Currently, there are two main repositories:

- [rust-web-app](https://github.com/rust10x/rust-web-app), a Rust Web Application designed for production. It will soon include Kubernetes support, full AWS deployment, and a multi-service architecture.

- [rust-ai-buddy](https://github.com/rust10x/rust-ai-buddy), a desktop application for interacting with AI services (cloud-based or local), such as OpenAI, ollama (local), or lamafile.

Both repositories are actively being developed, so be sure to subscribe to the [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/jeremychone) and follow this organization and its repositories.

Until the next one, happy coding!
